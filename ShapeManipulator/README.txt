This program is the final application project for Linear Algebra (MTH 227) at GVSU
during the fall semester of 2013.  It was written by Scott Bell.

The Shape Manipulator allows users to create shapes and change them using a variety 
of different functions.  Buttons are provided to the left of the shape display to 
create shapes.  Users can create default shapes by entering specifics about the
shape such as choice (square, triangle, or circle), side length/radius, and where
the center of the shape is located.  Users can also create their own custom shapes
by specifying how many vertices they want followed by the series of connections.

The available transformations are scaling, translation, rotation, and reflection.
There are also zoom options so that large and small shapes can be seen.  A default
zoom button is provided to return the user to the original zoom level.
